This repository contains Latex code to compile a
set of lower-division undergraduate lecture notes
on Waves and Oscillations.

The code will only compile correctly if the following
standard Tex packages are installed:

fullpage
epfs
charter
euler
fancyhdr

The document can be compiled by issuing the command

latex Waves

in the lowest directory (containing the file Waves.tex).

The document must be compiled at least three times to
get all of the cross-references and table of content
data correct.
